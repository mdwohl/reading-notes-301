## Mustache

Mustache is a way to use templates for HTML, config, source code and others that uses tags instead of if/else statements or loops. It uses only tags. Mustache.js implements this system for JS. Mustache provides specifications for templating, and then a templating engine is used to create an output by these specs.

## Flexbox

Flexbox layout attempts to provide an efficient layout in CSS within a container, especially valuable for containers whose size is unknown or dynamic. Its main idea is that it allows the container to change width and height (as well as display order) to use the available space. This is useful because modern websites are often views on many different types of displays and screen sizes. Flex containers expand to fill, and shrink to avoid overflow.

Notably, flexbox works best for smaller scale layouts (like a navbar) whereas a grid is more appropriate for larger layouts. 

Flexbox is directional (r to l) and also can be ordered numerically. It can grow, or wrap if necessary, allowing the elements to expand or move to fit the display space. Likewise, it can shrink. Content can also be aligned using justification and relative alignment.
