## Diversity and Inclusion in Tech

The statistics on representations in tech are sadly not surprising to me, and reflect larger issues with other avenues of our society. What I found surprising were the statistics in the QZ gender gap article about the turning point away from parity that took place.

The article's data is from 2014, so is not completely up to datew, but the idea that 10% of Twitter's workforce were women was pretty shocking when compared with the statistics about the field of CS. I was born in 1986; I saw very clearly the way video games were marketed to me and not my sister growing up (though I didn't understand that at the time) and unsurprisingly, I played a lot of games as a kid. It's interesting to think that the dropoff in female enrollment in CS programs coincided with that very same era.

Moreover, I think back on the encouragement I got when I was a kid towards exploration. My dad has always been an early adopter of technologies, so we had computers before many other families did. I was always encouraged to mess around with them. I recall thinking I wanted to be a computer programmer when I was 11 or 12, and no one ever suggested that was anything less than realistic and a great idea.

It's brutal to read the statistic about not a single young woman taking the AP CS exam in multiple states. I think representation in media goes a long way toward this end, and I have absolutely observed that representation to be skewed extremely male and White when we're talking about tech -- whether we mean those in the industry, or consumers of the products they make.

The experience gap that's discussed in the article has parallels with systemic inequalities in many other areas of our society, particular at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender. The lack of opportunity or encouragement for many marginalized groups feeds that disparity in aquisition of skills, and therefore representation in the workplace and in education.
