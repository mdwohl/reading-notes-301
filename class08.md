## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language -- it allows users to query, manipulate, and transform data. It's simple, safe, and scalable. There are many databases commonly used that all use the SQL language standard.

SQL uses *relational databases* -- two dimensional tables, in this case. Think of an Excel sheet. There are columns and rows of data. SQL enables us to answer specific questions about this data quickly and efficiently.

SQL data is retrieved with SELECT statements, known as queries. These queries can be general, or can target certain results with a WHERE clause. More complex queries can be built with AND and OR logicals, and numerical operators. This makes data targeting precise and manageable.

Further filtering can be done with DISTINCT, which removes duplicate rows, allowing our data to be more easily navigated. SQL can also sort results by column in ascending/descending order by using ORDER BY. LIMIT reduces the quantity of reduced rows, and OFFSET specifies where the starting point of counting the rows begins.
