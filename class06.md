## What is Node?

According to Stack Overflow, *"Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library."*

Node is a program that can run JS on our computers -- what's known as a JavaScript runtime. It includes a built-in package manager, called npm. This is the world's largest registry and can access over one million packages of JS.

Node helps to install and run build tools that automate and streamline the process of JavaScript app development. Many familiar JS frameworks (React, for example) relies on Node and its npms to create its dev environment.

Node is structured to interact with the server in a way that is particularly light and unburdensome, allowing actions to happen quickly and without bogging down the server when multiple requests come through.

Node is particularly useful in building apps that require real-time input or collaboration from or between users. Chat sites or CodeShare. It's also a strong candidate for data streaming as it allows files to process while uploading. Node's big strength is in real-time activity. From a dev point of view, you can do everything an app needs in Node, meaning that your life is easier in that you don't need to rely on multiple languages and constantly shift between them.
