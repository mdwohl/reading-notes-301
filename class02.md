### Class 02 Reading -- Pair Programming

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pair programming is efficient and helps catch mistakes! Talking through problems together helps to get to the root of things, and can reduce time where you feel "stuck". Research can be more effective, and it generally results in code that needs fewer fixes later.

1. Pair programming is more engaging. It's easy to lose focus on your own; having a partner keeps you on task and holds you accountable.

1. Working with another student expands your horizon and perspective. It exposes you to ideas and techniques that you might have missed. Students and programmers in pairs often teach one another.

1. Pair programming fosters the development of better social skills and communication. These skills are essential in the workplace, and devs who excel in soft skills are set apart from those who struggle communicating.

1. Pair programming is frequently a part of the interview process. Having this skill developed before interviewing will make it comfortable and familiar. It demonstrates a teamwork-oriented skillset to employers.

1. Pair programming happens in the workplace too! This is often a method for training new hires to learn new techniques and company practices.

Jquery offers streamlined solutions for accomplishing common JS tasks in a quick and consistent manner. Jquery can be used to select elements, perform tasks, and handle events. Jquery is a JS file that is included in web pages.

It is powerful in that it can use CSS selectors and then manipulate these elements with its own methods. Jquery can do a lot of the things DOM manipulation can, but in simpler syntax. It can target and manipulate.

Why use Jquery? Because it makes things simpler. It's steadily being used on huge percentages of the most visited sites on the web. Simple selectors and common tasks in less code mean more efficient development. Jquery offers element selectors that are common with CSS, but also has some of its own. It can also conveniently use multiple methods on the same elements via chaining for more compact code.

Jquery can be hosted on your website, or you can use a version hosted by another server. It's a good idea to use multiples so you have a fallback. A CDN, standing for content delivery network, is a server series spread out to serve static files quickly to facilitate easy loading. It's important to consider the order in which you add scripts with Jquery, as it can affect or conflict with other JS that your site is running.
